# Automated cross seeding with Prowlarr, cross-seed, and fertilizer

This is part 2 of the series: [Deluge via Proton VPN with port forwarding](https://github.com/RogueOneEcho/how-to-setup-deluge-with-protonvpn-portforward).

This part adds Prowlarr, cross-seed, and fertilizer to the stack for automatic cross seeding.

## Technologies
- [Prowlarr](https://prowlarr.com/) for managing indexers.
- [cross-seed v6](https://github.com/cross-seed/cross-seed) for cross seeding movie and TV torrents between indexers.
- [Fertilizer](https://github.com/moleculekayak/fertilizer) for cross seeding music torrents between indexers.

## How it works
